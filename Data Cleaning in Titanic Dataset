# 1) How many Rows and Columns do you have?
dim(df) #to get no. of rows & columns

# 2) Check the datatype of each column. Make sure they make sense, if not change the data type of the columns.
str(df)#data tyoe fo each column
df$PassengerId=as.factor(df$PassengerId)
df$Survived=as.factor(df$Survived)
df$Pclass=as.factor(df$Pclass)
#check again
str(df)

# 4) After changing the data types run the summary function and study the output.
summary(df)

# 3) How many Male and Female are present?
table(df$Sex)

# 5) Of the total Passengers, How many survived and how many did not. (hint use table function)
table(df$Survived)#549 did not and 342 survived

# 6) What proportion Survived?
prop.table(table(df$Survived))*100#to get the proportion

# 7) How many Male Survived. (hint Table function can take >1 inputs)
table(df$Survived,df$Sex)

# 8) How many Passengers do you have in each Pclass.
table(df$Pclass)

# 9) Draw histogram for the Fare paid. 
hist(df$Fare,breaks=40)

# 10) Find the mean Fare paid by Passengers in each Pclass. 
tapply(df$Fare,df$Pclass,mean,na.rm=T)

# 11) How many Passengers embarked the Ship and at which Station?
table(df$Embarked)

# 12) Count the number of missing values in each column? Does embarked column has any missing value?? Notice carefully.
apply(df,2,function(x){sum(is.na(x))}) #slightly advanced function
sum(df$Embarked=="")#embarked has spaces in it..

# 13) Create a smaller dataframe with (all Male and travelling first class) and another df with all female OR anybody 
# below the Age of 20. How many rows are in each df.
all_male_P1=subset(df,df$Sex=="male" & df$Pclass==1)
all_female_Age=subset(df,df$Sex=="female"| df$Age<20)

# 14) What is the # of Male and Female Survived with respect to each Pclass
table(df$Survived,df$Pclass) #or tapply(df$Survived,df$Pclass,function(x){sum(x==1)})
tapply(df$Survived,df$Pclass,function(x){sum(x==1)})
table(df$Pclass) #to see total passengers in each class

# 15) Use grep to create a subset of all Passenger who survived. Call it df_survived. Whats the number of rows?

df_Survived=df[grep("1",df$Survived), ]
df_Survived=df[,grep("1",df$Survived) ]

dim(df_Survived) 
head(df_Survived)

# 16) Find all the columns which has the letter ‘e ’ in the column name. How many columns do you get?

df_col_name_with_e=df[, grep("e" ,colnames(df))]
df_col_name_with_e=df[grep("e" ,colnames(df)), ]


dim(df_col_name_with_e)
head(df_col_name_with_e)

# 17) Fill the Missing Values of Age separately for the Male and Female by their Averages.
sum(is.na(df$Age))
tapply(df$Age,df$Sex,mean,na.rm=T)
df$Age[is.na(df$Age) & df$Sex=="male"]=30.72
df$Age[is.na(df$Age) & df$Sex=="female"]=27.91
sum(is.na(df$Age))


# 18) Create a new column with the first name of each passenger. Call this column “First name”
# strsplit function--
# finding the FIEST, LAST AND TITLE FROM PASSENGERS NAMES 
head(df$Name)
df$Name[1]
#to split the Name we will have to convert the nmaes to characters first. Y?
#because DataType Factors cannot be changed... All characters are by default read as
#factors when you use the read.csv function.
df$Name=as.character(df$Name)
head(df$Name)#this tells us that to separate the Title , First and last Name
#we will ahve to use , and . as the separator.

strsplit(df$Name[1],"[,.]") # this dpes it and gives frst the Sirname, then Title and 
#the First name. the output is in the form of a list

strsplit(df$Name[1],"[,.]")[[1]][1] # gives the last anme
strsplit(df$Name[1],"[,.]")[[1]][2] #gives the title
strsplit(df$Name[1],"[,.]")[[1]][3] #gives the First Name

#notice the Title and First name has a space before them;;we can repale them with no space
#using the sub(substitute) function
sub("b","d","abc") #means substitute b by d in the string abc

# so to substutute the spaces in Ttile and First name we use
sub(" ","",strsplit(df$Name[1],"[,.]")[[1]][2]) #perfect
sub(" ","",strsplit(df$Name[1],"[,.]")[[1]][3]) #perfect
#nows lets create the columns

df$FirstName=sapply(df$Name,function(x){strsplit(x,"[,.]")[[1]][3]})
#check Check
head(df$FirstName)
#now replace the spaces
df$FirstName=sub(" ", "",df$FirstName)

# 19) Create a new column with the last name of each passenger. Call this column “last name”
df$LastName=sapply(df$Name,function(x){strsplit(x,"[,.]")[[1]][1]})
#check Check
head(df$LastName)

# 20) Create a new column with the Title of each passenger. Call this column “Title” (e.g. Mr, Miss etc)
df$Title=sapply(df$Name,function(x){strsplit(x,"[,.]")[[1]][2]})
#check Check
head(df$Title)

#now replace the spaces
df$Title=sub(" ","",df$Title)
#check Check
head(df$Title)
